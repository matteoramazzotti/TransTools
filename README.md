# TransTools
Personal repository containng R / perl / bash scripts and tools for transcriptomics

mM_Net.R
 - Intersects miRNA/Gene interaction data from pITA and miRTarBase
 - Loads gene and microRna expression data
 - Loads a list of genes with proven differential expression (DE)
 - Loads a list of microRNAs with proven differential expression (DE)
 - Performs a correlation analysis on selected miRNA/gene
 - Produce a colored (by logFC) network that represent interaction netowrks

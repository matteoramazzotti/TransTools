# TransTools
Personal repository containng R / perl / bash scripts and tools for transcriptomics

<b>mM_Net.R</b>
 - Intersects miRNA/gene interaction data from pITA and miRTarBase
 - Loads miRNA and gene expression data
 - Loads miRNA and genes with proven differential expression (DE)
 - Performs a correlation analysis on DE miRNA/gene using their expression data
 - Produce a colored (by logFC) network that represents miRNAs/genes interaction netowrks
